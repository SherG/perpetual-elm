This is a time of high uncertainty and risk. For many companies the coronavirus lockdown has made existing debt unmanageable. The list of companies that have stopped paying vendors and rent is rising, as is the number filing for bankruptcy. 

The good news is that businesses that use a particular type of factoring can protect their AR from their customers’ insolvency.

## What is Factoring? 

Factoring is a form of debt-free financing where you sell your 30-, 60-, or 90-day B2B or B2G invoices to a factor for immediate cash. Typically, 80%-90% of the value of the invoices is advanced immediately. 

Your factor will manage your AR and your customers will pay their invoices to the factor. 
Once your customer pays their invoice, the factor provides the remaining amount to you, minus a fee. 

## Failure to Pay

But what happens if a customer fails to pay their invoice? Some factors not only charge high rates they also will hold the client liable for the customers’ non-payment. This is called “recourse factoring.” Some of these companies offer installment payment plans, which require you to pay back the full amount of the invoice plus fees if your customers fail to pay their invoices. This scenario can lead to a debt spiral. 

## Trade Risk Insurance

Businesses that take advantage of invoice factoring need to be protected against the potential bankruptcy of their customers. That’s where trade risk insurance (or credit risk insurance) comes in. 

However a business with a small client base may find that credit risk insurance comes at a steep price.
