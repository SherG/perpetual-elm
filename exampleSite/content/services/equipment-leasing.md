There are multiple ways to obtain the equipment you need for your business. 

These include (but are not limited to):

1. Equipment leasing
2. [Syndicated Line of Credit (SLOC)](/services/sloc)
3. [Invoice Factoring ](/services/invoice-factoring)

## Equipment Leasing

Your equipment leasing options are:

* Capital lease: Through an Equipment Finance Agreement (EFA) you may arrange to keep the equipment once it's paid off. (A capital lease is sometimes referred to as a finance lease or sales lease.)
* Operating lease: This is the lower cost option. At the end of the agreement you'll have the option to return the equipment, extend the lease, or lease new equipment.
