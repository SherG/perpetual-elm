There are multiple ways to obtain the equipment you need for your business.

These include:

1. Equipment financing / leasing
2. [Syndicated Line of Credit (SLOC)](/services/sloc)
3. [Invoice Factoring ](/services/invoice-factoring)

Purchasing assets with cash presents unique risks to the business owner, including tying capital up.

Equipment financing can be a risk management solution which frees cash up for other operations like inventory, marketing, and hiring. Using a capital lease to finance can yield significant cash savings, thanks to IRS Section 179. 

## Equipment Finance Structures

1. Capital lease: Through an Equipment Finance Agreement (EFA) you may arrange to keep the equipment once it's paid off. (A capital lease is sometimes referred to as a finance lease or sales lease.) 
2. Operating lease: This is the lower cost option. At the end of the agreement you'll have the option to return the equipment, extend the lease, or lease new equipment.

### Capital Lease

This option is an on balance sheet structure. Equipment can be recorded as an asset and depreciated, which means the payments are not fully tax-deductible. 

#### Section 179: Deduct Up to $1 Million

However, thanks to Section 179 of the IRS tax code, you can deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and software from your gross revenue. This can save you hundreds of thousands of dollars on your equipment purchases. 

Here's an example of how Section 179 works:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Equipment purchases:</td>
    <td>$1,150,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>First year write-off:<br>($1 million maximum in 2019)</td>
    <td>$1,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>100% Bonus first year depreciation</td>
    <td>$150,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total first year deduction:</td>
    <td>$1,150,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cash savings: <br>($1,150,000 x 35% tax rate)<br></td>
    <td>$402,500</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Equipment cost after tax: <br>(Assuming a 35% tax bracket)</td>
    <td><mark>$747,500</mark></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>

  </tr>
