There are multiple ways to obtain the equipment you need for your business.

These include:

1. Equipment financing
2. [Syndicated Line of Credit (SLOC)](/services/sloc)
3. [Invoice Factoring](/services/invoice-factoring)

Financing equipment can mitigate the risks inherent in the purchase or large-ticket assets and free cash up for inventory, marketing, research and development, and other costs.

## Why Finance Equipment?

* Maintain and free up cash flow
* Benefit from IRS Section 179 (applicable to capital leases)
* Keep up to date with new technology
* Leverage equipment expertise
* 100% financing with zero down payment available in some cases

## Equipment Finance Structures

We focus on two options: capital lease or operating lease. 

### Equipment Finance Agreement (EFA)

<br/><strong>Capital Lease</strong>: Through an Equipment Finance Agreement (EFA) you make monthly payments over a term period of years and own the equipment once it's paid off. (A capital lease is sometimes referred to as a finance lease or sales lease.) 

This is an on-balance sheet structure. Equipment is recorded as an asset and can be depreciated, which means the payments are not fully tax-deductible. 

### Save Money With Section 179

<br/>However, thanks to Section 179 of the IRS tax code, you can deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and software -- up to $1 million -- from your gross revenue. You can also deduct 100% of the depreciation. 

Here's an example of how Section 179 works:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="background-color: #f4f5fa">Equipment purchases:</td>
    <td style="background-color: #f4f5fa">$1,190,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>First year write-off:<br>($1 million maximum in 2019)</td>
    <td>$1,000,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="background-color: #f4f5fa">100% Bonus first year depreciation</td>
    <td style="background-color: #f4f5fa">$190,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total first year deduction:</td>
    <td>$1,190,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="background-color: #f4f5fa">Cash savings: <br>($1,190,000 x 35% tax rate)<br></td>
    <td style="background-color: #f4f5fa"><mark>$416,500</mark></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Equipment cost after tax: <br>(Assuming a 35% tax bracket)</td>
    <td>$773,500</mark></td>
  </tr>
</table><br/>

### Fair Market Value (FMV)

<br/>Under an <strong>operating lease</strong>, you make monthly payments on your equipment. 

At the end of the term you have the option to buy the equipment at fair market value, return the equipment, finance it again, or lease new equipment.

This is off-balance sheet financing. Most FMV lease payments are 100% tax deductible. 

An operating lease is a good option for businesses that need to regularly upgrade to recent models.
