Credit card stacking provides entrepreneurs with access to additional capital by combining the total credit of multiple cards into a single line of unsecured business credit. 

This is a popular option for startups, those who need fast funding, and existing low-revenue businesses seeking to expand. 

Approval is fast and cards are typically received in 7-10 days.
