SBA loans are popular for their low rates and flexible terms. They typically have more stringent criteria than other funding options.

This is not a fast funding option. SBA loans can technically be approved in a week, but typically take 2-3 months to be processed. We can structure deals that provide funding from other sources to bridge that waiting period.

## What is an SBA loan?

An SBA loan is a business loan insured by the U.S. government. There are a variety of SBA loan types available, each designed for a specific purpose. 

Funds received through SBA loans can be operating capital and long-term fixed assets. Some SBA loans have restrictions on use.

* The average 7a loan amount in 2018 was approximately $425,500 according to the SBA
* The maximum loan amount is $5.5 million
* Monthly payments are fixed
* Payback periods may range up to 25 years for acquisitions or commercial property
* Interest rates are capped by the SBA
* Approval is more difficult to obtain than for a LOC (line of credit), invoice factoring, or merchant cash advance. 

## Basic Eligibility Requirements

* In business for 2 years (Startup SBAs are possible but are more difficult to acquire)
* Minimum 650 FICO score
* No recent bankruptcies or delinquencies on previous government loans

## General Rates

Two rates come into play with SBA loans:

* The prime rate, which is posted daily in the _Wall St. Journal_ and which can be affected by  actions of the Federal Reserve. The current prime rate is 5.25%. 
* The lender spread

The borrower and lender can negotiate the interest rate, which is capped by the SBA.

### SBA 7(a) loans

These loans are the SBA's primary vehicle for small business funding. 

Funds from 7(a) loans can be used in a variety of ways, including for working capital, expansion, fixed assets, and equipment purchases. 

There are seven different 7(a) loan types. Terms may vary between them.

  The SBA states that: "Lenders are not required to take collateral for loans up to $25,000. For loans over $25,000, up to and including $350,000, the lender must follow the collateral policies and procedures that it has established and implemented for its similarly-sized non-SBA-guaranteed commercial loans, but at a minimum the lender must take a first lien on assets financed with loan proceeds and lender must take a lien on all of the applicant’s fixed assets including real estate. Lender is not required to take a lien against applicant’s real estate when the equity is less than 25% of the fair market value. The lender may limit the lien taken against real estate to the loan amount."
