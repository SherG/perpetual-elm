SBA loans are popular for their low rates and flexible terms. They typically have more stringent criteria than other funding options.

This is not a fast funding option. SBA loans can technically be approved in a week, but typically take 2-3 months to be processed. We can structure deals that provide funding from other sources to bridge that waiting period.

## What is an SBA loan?

An SBA loan is a business loan insured by the U.S. government. There are a variety of SBA loan types available, each designed for a specific purpose. 

### SBA 7(a) loans

These loans are the SBA's primary program for small business funding. Funds from 7ba loans can be used in a variety of ways, including for working capital, expansion, and equipment purchases. 

There are seven different 7(a) loan types, and terms may vary between them. Among these types are express loans with fast approval times, and loans for exporters and veterans.

5. Export Working Capital
6. International Trade

## General Rates

Two rates come into play with SBA loans:

* The prime rate, which is posted daily in the _Wall St. Journal_ and which can be affected by  actions of the Federal Reserve. The current prime rate is 5.25%. 
* The lender spread

The borrower and lender can negotiate the interest rate, which is capped by the SBA. 

## Who is a Good Fit for an SBA Loan?

Because applying for an SBA loan can be a time-consuming process, you'll want to make sure this is a good option for your business. 

If you've been in business for at least 2 years, you have good credit, have the cash flow to support the loan payments, and your business finances are in good order, then an SBA loan is a good option for you. 

## What Documents Are Required?

Documents that you'll need to furnish include (but are not limited to): 

* 2-3 years of business and personal tax returns
* Profit and Loss Statement
* Balance sheet and complete list of business debt
* Business entity documents, proof of insurance, business location proof 
* SBA Forms 1919 and 1920
