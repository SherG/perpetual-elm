SBA loans are popular for their low rates and flexible terms. They typically have more stringent criteria than other funding options.

This is not a fast funding option. SBA loans can technically be approved in a week, but typically take 2-3 months to be processed. We can structure deals that provide funding from other sources to bridge that waiting period.

## What is an SBA loan?

An SBA loan is a business loan insured by the U.S. government. There are a variety of SBA loan types available, each designed for a specific purpose. 

Funds received through SBA loans can be operating capital and long-term fixed assets. Some SBA loans have restrictions on use.

* The average 7a loan amount in 2018 was approximately $425,500 according to the SBA
* The maximum loan amount is $5.5 million
* Monthly payments are fixed
* Payback periods may range up to 25 years for acquisitions or commercial property
* Interest rates are capped by the SBA
* Approval is more difficult to obtain than for a LOC (line of credit), invoice factoring, or merchant cash advance. 

## Basic Eligibility Requirements

* In business for 2 years (Startup SBAs are possible but are more difficult to acquire)
* Minimum 650 FICO score
* No recent bankruptcies or delinquencies on previous government loans

## General Rates

Two rates come into play with SBA loans:

* The prime rate, which is posted daily in the _Wall St. Journal_ and which can be affected by  actions of the Federal Reserve. The current prime rate is 5.25%. 
* The lender spread

The borrower and lender can negotiate the interest rate, which is capped by the SBA. 

## Who is a Good Fit for an SBA Loan?

Because applying for an SBA loan can be a time-consuming process, you'll want to make sure this is a good option for your business before you begin.

If you've been in business for at least 2 years, you have good credit, have the cash flow to support the loan payments, and your business finances are in good order, then an SBA loan is a good option for you. 

## What Documents Are Required?

Documents that you'll need to furnish include (but are not limited to): 

* 2-3 years of business and personal tax returns
* Profit and Loss Statement
* Balance sheet and complete list of business debt
* Business entity documents, proof of insurance, business location proof 
* SBA Forms 1919 and 1920
* Depending upon the type of SBA loan you apply for, additional forms may be required

## Types of SBA Loans

1. 7(a) loan program
2. 504 loan program

### SBA 7(a) loans

* SBA turnound time: 5-10 business days
* Collateral: The SBA states that: "Lenders are not required to take collateral for loans up to $25,000. For loans in excess of $350,000, the SBA requires that the lender collateralize the loan to the maximum extent possible up to the loan amount. If business fixed assets do not 'fully secure' the loan the lender may include trading assets (using 10% of current book value for the calculation), and must take available equity in the personal real estate (residential and investment) of the principals as collateral."

Lender is not required to take a lien against applicant’s real estate when the equity is less than 25% of the fair market value. The lender may limit the lien taken against real estate to the loan amount."
