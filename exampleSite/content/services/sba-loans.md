SBA loans are popular for their low rates and flexible terms. They typically have more stringent criteria than other funding options.

This is not a fast funding option. SBA loans can technically be approved in a week, but typically take 2-3 months to be processed. We can structure deals that provide funding from other sources to bridge that waiting period.

## What is an SBA loan?

An SBA loan is a business loan insured by the U.S. government. 

* Loan amounts typically range from $25,000 to $5.5 million.
* The average loan amount is approximately $370,000 
* Monthly payments are fixed
* Payback periods may range up to 25 years for acquisitions or commercial property
* Approval is more difficult to obtain than for a LOC (line of credit), invoice factoring, or merchant cash advance. 

## Basic Requirements

* In business for 2 years (Startup SBAs are possible but are more difficult to acquire)
* Minimum 650 FICO score
* No recent bankruptcies or delinquencies on previous government loans

## General Rates

Two rates come into play with SBA loans:

* The prime rate, which is posted daily in the _Wall St. Journal_ and which can be affected by  actions of the Federal Reserve. 
* The lender spread

The current prime rate is 5.25%. 

## Who is a Good Fit for an SBA Loan?

Because applying for an SBA loan can be a time-consuming process, you'll want to make sure this is a good option for your business. 

If you've been in business for at least 2 years, you have good credit, have the cash flow to support the loan payments, and your business finances are in good order, then an SBA loan is a good option for you. 

Merchants who have poor credit or have struggling businesses should seek a different option. 

## What Documents Are Required? 

Documents that you'll need to furnish include (but are not limited to): 

* 2-3 years of business and personal tax returns
* Profit and Loss Statement
* Balance sheet and complete list of business debt
* Business entity documents, proof of insurance, business location proof
