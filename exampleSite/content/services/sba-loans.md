SBA loans are popular for their low rates and flexible terms. They typically have more stringent criteria than other funding options.

This is not a fast funding option. SBA loans can technically be approved in a week, but typically take 2-3 months to be processed. 

We can structure deals that provide funding from other sources to bridge that waiting period.

## What is an SBA loan?

An SBA loan is a business loan insured by the U.S. government. There are a variety of SBA loan types available, each designed for a specific purpose. 

Funds received through SBA loans can be used for operating capital, fixed assets, and [equipment purchases](/services/equipment-leasing/). Some SBA loans have restrictions on use.

* The average 7(a) loan amount in 2018 was approximately $425,500 according to SBA data
* The maximum loan amount is $5.5 million
* Monthly payments are fixed
* Payback periods may range up to 25 years for acquisitions or commercial property
* Interest rates are capped by the SBA
* Approval is more difficult to obtain than for a LOC (line of credit), invoice factoring, or merchant cash advance. 

## Basic Eligibility Requirements

* In business for 2 years (Startup SBAs are possible but are more difficult to acquire)
* Minimum 650 FICO score
* No recent bankruptcies or delinquencies on previous government loans

## General Rates

Two rates come into play with SBA loans:

* The prime rate, which is posted daily in the _Wall St. Journal_ and which can be affected by  actions of the Federal Reserve. The current prime rate is 5.25%. 
* The lender spread

The borrower and lender can negotiate the interest rate, which is capped by the SBA.
