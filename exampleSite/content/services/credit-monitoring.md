Every entrepreneur needs to proactively manage their identity and credit score like they do their own business.

The frequency and complexity of identity theft crime is escalating. It can be difficult to know which solution to choose to protect oneself.

Inadequate protection can leave you victimized by:

* Credit card fraud
* Mortgage fraud
* Depleted bank or retirement account funds
* Stolen tax refunds
* Damaged credit

We have partnered with a vetted firm that meets our highest standards and provides:

* Business-grade credit protection that covers closed trade lines, paid trade lines, authorized users, lost and stolen cards, charge-offs, retail cards that go over the limit, and much more.
* Business-grade credit and identity monitoring which includes when authorized users are added to your credit cards.
* Social Security Number tracing. Monitors for when anyone uses your SSN. This is unlike other services that simply flag when your SSN number is used with a wrong address or wrong name.
* Application monitoring: Scans and alerts for any new accounts opened using your identity. Includes applications for cellphone or utility services, payday loans, or credit cards.
* Up to $1 million in identity theft insurance
* Credit reports: You'll have access to reports from all 3 bureaus in an easy-to-read format. Unlike some popular monitoring solutions, this one isn't missing critical details. 
* Soft pulls that don't affect your credit
