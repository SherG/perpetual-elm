Business funding can be denied due to credit issues. In many cases, derogatory items can be permanently removed. 

We work with an established and respected firm that handles these issues for our clients. Our partner is the go-to solution for mortgage brokers, real estate agents, loan brokers, and auto dealerships. 

* Derogatory items are addressed quickly and the process is completed within 60-90 days
* Items are permanently removed 
* Your credit repair representative will explain any steps that you may need to take

Note: You do not need to be a client of ours to use the credit repair service.
