Tired of dealing with an endless series of faxes, phone calls, and a pile of documents to sign? Our proprietary process is completed in a few easy steps. 

## What's required to get an SLOC?

If a merchant has good history and no derogatory information, an approval will likely be obtained. Requires good credit (700 or above) or an approved co-signer.

## What is a syndicated line of credit (SLOC)?

A syndicated line of credit is a loan backed by a group of investors. The loan comes in the form of a credit card that can be used as cash.

Uses for SLOC include: 

1. Startup funding
2. Expansion of business operations
3. Bridge capital
4. Replacing critical equipment (such as a restaurant stove) without having to wait for a bank loan.
5. Opening a second location

You'll apply online, get fast approval and same day funding.

Our process requires very limited asset verification, no business appraisal and little to no paperwork. The process is simple.

## Will derogatory credit information affect my application?

Some merchants we work with have good history but have derogatory information in their credit. 

In this event, it may be possible to get that derogatory information removed and still get approval and a good deal. This process usually takes a few weeks.

## Apply for an SLOC first

If you're interested in an SLOC it's best to apply for it first, before applying for other forms of fast funding, like a merchant cash advance. This is because other inquiries will be added to your credit report which may make it harder to get an SLCO approved.

## What is the maximum amount available via an SLOC?

With good credit it's possible to obtain up to $300,000 if the merchant uses 2 additional guarantors. In other words, the merchant will have to have 2 or 3 additional cosigners with perfect credit no exceptions.

## Combination funding

If you want more than $100k and don't want to use additional guarantors, we may be able to structure a deal for you that provides you with funding from more than one source. 

For example, a business owner may opt for $300k via a low-interest [SBA loan](/services/sba-loan/) and cover immediate funding needs with a 24-hour [merchant cash advance](/services/merchant-cash-advance/), SLOC, or [invoice factoring](/services/invoice-factoring/).
