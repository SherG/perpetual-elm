Did you know that you if your business sells B2B or B2G you can sell your accounts receivables (AR) and get cash the same day or within 24 hours? This process is called "invoice factoring." 

For businesses selling on 30, 60, or 90-day terms, invoice factoring can solve important cash flow problems, like meeting payroll, paying suppliers on time, and covering overhead and other expenses. 

Factoring can also enable small businesses to take advantage of growth opportunities that require bridge capital.

## How does invoice factoring work?

You'll submit your invoices and supporting documentation. If it's received by noon, you can get funded the same day. 

1. Your invoices are purchased at a small discount
2. You'll receive between 80% - 90% of the invoice value the same day or typically, within 24 hours. The amount you receive depends on your situation. 
3. Once the customer pays their invoice you receive the _remaining amount_, minus a small fee for the service. 

In invoice factoring, it's your _**customer's credit score**_ that's key. 

## Removing the credit risk: non-recourse factoring

Factoring that includes credit risk insurance is called "non-recourse factoring." 

With non-recourse factoring, even if your customer goes bankrupt, you won't be liable for the payment.

 By contrast "full recourse" factoring holds you liable for the full amount of the invoice.
