## Applying For Business Funding

Consent to Conduct Business Electronically

By filling out our application, you acknowledge that you have carefully read and agree to the Spearfish Terms and Conditions  in its entirety, as well as our Privacy Policy found here: [https://www.spearfishcap.com/privacy-policy](/privacy-policy/)/

(a) send electronic disclosures to the email address(es) provided by you, including all relevant documents, notices, and contracts.

By submitting your information, you are providing express “written” consent to be contacted by one of our funding specialists in order to schedule and conduct your free consultation.

Filling out one of our contact forms, landing pages, or sending us your contact information and/or participating in a free consultation in no way guarantees that you or your business will be determined to be eligible for funding or be eligible for a specific amount or be eligible for specific terms or rates. We use third-party businesses to verify your information, to determine your eligibility, and to perform underwriting. Requirements for approval vary between funding options and may include good personal or business (Paydex) credit, credit of a particular score and/or “depth” (quality), minimum monthly revenue, minimum annual net salary, good credit on your customers’ part (in the case of invoice factoring), a set length of time in business, one or more co-signers, and other factors. 

Credit requirements for particular funding options may include no bankruptcies, or no recent bankruptcies; no personal or bank liens; and other factors. Spearfish is not a bank or a financial institution and does not provide direct funding. Funding that is approved is approved by and dispersed by our underwriting, factoring, and finance partners.

The “soft pull” initiated by Spearfish will not affect your credit score, but credit inquiries by our business partners may impact your credit score.

The information from your credit report, among other considerations, will be used in determining your eligibility for certain financial products in the assessment of the financial readiness of your business to receive funding.  

You understand that our partners, at their sole discretion, may approve or decline your application and may or may not provide us with the details of their decision. The credit inquiries conducted by our business partners may or may not have an impact on your personal credit score.

You understand and acknowledge that receiving disclosures, notices, and agreements via email is required to fulfill your request for business funding.

You may withdraw your consent to receive marketing or other automated emails at any time by clicking “unsubscribe” at the bottom of the Spearfish email you receive, but this will not prevent us from contacting your email with relevant updates or information regarding the status of your application for business funding or providing relevant account details.

During the application process you may withdraw your consent to receive all emails by contacting data@spearfishcap.com, but understand that doing so will prohibit you from using our services or accessing any funding products offered through the site.

You authorize Spearfish and our partners to contact you using any telephone numbers, including but not limited to; landline, mobile, and VOIP numbers, that you supply.

You agree that we may use prerecorded messages when leaving voicemails and may use automatic dialing technology to contact you.

You understand and acknowledge that receiving phone calls from Spearfish and our business partners is required to fulfill your request for business funding and to manage that relationship.

During the application process you may withdraw your consent to receive all calls from Spearfish by emailing us at data@spearfishcap.com and requesting to be placed on our “do not call” list.

#### Limitations on Withdrawing Consent to Electronic Communications

Please note, if you have previously submitted your information to Spearfish, have provided us multiple phone numbers or email addresses, or have corresponded directly with one of our representatives in addition to using the Site, then we may have duplicate contact information associated with your account.

While we make every effort process all requests to withdraw communication consent, you may be still contacted in error. Please notify us at data@spearfishcap.com if such an error occurs and we will take appropriate measures to resolve the issue.

You also acknowledge that withdrawing consent for one form of communication shall be exclusive to that form (for example, “unsubscribing” from emails will not automatically place you on a “do not call” list).

If you have received a funding product through your use of Spearfish services and request to withdraw consent, then the separate terms and conditions of the funding agreement will take precedence, and Spearfish, our business partners, and any representative or agent acting on their or our behalf may contact you by any means and as needed for any purpose, including enforcing contractual or legal rights and obligations.

You further understand and acknowledge that our affiliates, vendors, business parties, or any third parties with whom we have shared your information have their own Terms of Use and Privacy Policies that may differ from our own, therefore requests to withdraw consent must be directed to these third parties and may not be fulfilled in all cases.

### Consent to Contact Third-Parties

You agree that by linking your bank account via API through a third-party to Spearfish, you grant us the authority as your agent to access this information at any time and as needed to monitor your performance.

Spearfish bears no responsibility for the content, or availability of the content, provided by or through the use of third-party API’s.

## Monitoring and Privacy

You acknowledge and agree that any of your electronic communications with us, including telephone calls, may be monitored or recorded at any time and without notice.

Monitoring may involve an ongoing review of your business bank account if linked by a secured third-party, updating an inquiry into your credit, and reviewing your communications with us for quality assurance or training purposes, and to assess your financial readiness to receive business funding now or in the future.

Recording may also include tracking your activity on the Site or saving data files of your communications with Spearfish. All communications are subject to the Spearfish Privacy Policy (found here: https://www.spearfishcap.com/privacy-policy/), which is incorporated by reference in these Terms of Use.

You understand and agree that certain information or communications may be disclosed if required by law or legal process, or at the request of a third-party with reasonable cause, or if necessary to protect, defend, or enforce Spearfish’s rights.
