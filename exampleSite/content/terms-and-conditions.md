These terms and conditions relate to the submission of your contact information via any Spearfish landing page or via any appointment booking software or by phone or email. \

By submitting your information, you are providing express "written" consent to be contacted by one of our funding specialists in order to schedule and conduct your free consultation. Should you choose to pursue a funding option, we may share your information with any of our partners who create, analyze, assess, offer, amend, finalize, and process funding deals. This may include third-party underwriters, factoring specialists and funding and finance partners. 

Filling out one of our contact forms, landing pages, or sending us your contact information and/or participating in a free consultation in no way guarantees that you or your business will be determined to be eligible for funding. We use third-party businesses to assess and determine your eligibility and to perform underwriting. Requirements for approval vary between funding options and may include good credit, credit of a particular score, minimum monthly revenue, minimum annual net salary, good credit on your customers’ part (in the case of invoice factoring), a set length of time in business, one or more co-signers, and other factors. Credit requirements for particular funding options may include no bankruptcies, or no recent bankruptcies; no personal or bank liens; and other factors. Spearfish is not a bank or a financial institution and does not provide direct funding. Funding that is approved is approved by and dispersed by our factoring, funding, and finance partners. Spearfish is an independent sales organization offering factor broker, equipment leasing broker, and loan broker services for small businesses. Spearfish is a trade name of Spearfish Capital Funding LLC.
