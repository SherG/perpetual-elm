## Submission of Information and Eligibility Determinations

The following terms and conditions relate to the submission of your contact information via any Spearfish landing page or via any appointment booking software or by phone, email, or in person.

By submitting your information, you are providing express “written” consent to be contacted by one of our funding specialists in order to schedule and conduct your free consultation.

Filling out one of our contact forms, landing pages, or sending us your contact information and/or participating in a free consultation in no way guarantees that you or your business will be determined to be eligible for funding or be eligible for a specific amount or be eligible for specific terms or rates. We use third-party businesses to verify your information, to determine your eligibility, and to perform underwriting. Requirements for approval vary between funding options and may include good personal or business (Paydex) credit, credit of a particular score and/or “depth” (quality), minimum monthly revenue, minimum annual net salary, good credit on your customers’ part (in the case of invoice factoring), a set length of time in business, one or more co-signers, and other factors. 

Credit requirements for particular funding options may include no bankruptcies, or no recent bankruptcies; no personal or bank liens; and other factors. Spearfish is not a bank or a financial institution and does not provide direct funding. Funding that is approved is approved by and dispersed by our underwriting, factoring, and finance partners. Spearfish is an independent sales organization providing factor broker, equipment leasing broker, and loan broker services for small businesses. 

## Timing of Funding

Timing of funding: If you receive approval for funding, the time frame that you receive that funding in, is not guaranteed by Spearfish. It may vary depending on when you provide the necessary information and/or fill out the necessary forms, how quickly you respond to request(s) for follow up communication(s), your bank’s policies, and/or any co-occurring and/or relevant event such as natural or geopolitical disasters, electricity blackouts, or human or technology errors.
