This is done through factoring and purchase order financing -- forms of business financing that don't add debt to your bottom line. 

* Through factoring, our partners purchase your outstanding 30-, 60-, or 90-day invoices for immediate cash, minus a small fee. 
* Through purchase order financing, product importers, distributors, and resellers can fulfill large orders before generating an invoice. 
* Through supply chain financing, companies can initiate advance payment to a supplier. 

Our solutions are cost-effective and simple. 

This service is for businesses selling B2B or B2G (business-to-government) with a minimal average monthly revenue of $25k.

All factoring deals brokered through Spearfish include credit risk insurance. This protects you from customers who may fail to pay their invoices if they become insolvent during the factoring period.

## Advisory Services and Consulting

We can structure deals that include various forms of financing such as SBA loans. Tell us about your situation and goals and we'll advise on smart options. 

From there we'll handle the application process and work with our financial partners to provide funding solutions to those who qualify.

In addition, we provide free advisory services to early stage businesses.

We have a reputation for transparency and candid advising.

## Crisis, Innovation, and Global Recession

Following the 2008 recession, small business owners found it increasingly difficult to obtain the funding they needed.  

Banks, laboring under substantial losses, grappled with new regulatory and capital requirements.  

In this environment, small business loans -- already viewed as risky -- were considered unattractive. 

Innovators stepped into the gap and an entire movement known as alternative lending or alternative finance was launched.

We're about to enter a new global recession.  And we can expect new innovations to come out of this challenging period as well.
