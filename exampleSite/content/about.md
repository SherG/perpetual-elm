As the coronavirus advances into nearly all countries, volatility in the markets has increased and businesses must now manage for a supply and demand shock. 

Spearfish works with businesses to quickly optimize their cash flow and solve supply chain financing problems. 

Our speciality is invoice factoring, a form of business financing that doesn't add debt to your bottom line. Through factoring, our partners purchase your outstanding 30-, 60-, or 90-day invoices for immediate cash, minus a fee. 

This service is for businesses selling B2B or B2G (business-to-government) with a minimal average monthly revenue of $20k. 

All factoring deals brokered through Spearfish include credit risk insurance. This protects you from customers who may fail to pay their invoices if they become insolvent during the factoring period.

## Advisory Services and Consulting

We can structure deals that include various forms of financing such as SBA loans. Tell us about your situation and goals and we'll advise on smart options. 

From there we'll handle the application process and work with our financial partners to provide funding solutions to those who qualify.

In addition, we serve as advisors to early stage businesses in the Boston metro area. 

We have a reputation for transparency and candid advising. 

## Crisis and innovation

Following the 2008 recession, small business owners found it increasingly difficult to obtain the funding they needed.  

Banks, laboring under substantial losses, grappled with new regulatory and capital requirements.  

In this environment, small business loans -- already viewed as risky -- were considered unattractive. 

Innovators stepped into the gap and an entire movement known as alternative lending or alternative finance was launched.

We're about to enter a new global recession.  And we can expect new innovations to come out of this challenging period as well.
