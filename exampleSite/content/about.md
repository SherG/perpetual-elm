Spearfish is an independent sales organization offering factor broker and loan broker services to small businesses. 

Our speciality is invoice factoring, a form of business financing that doesn't add debt to your bottom line. Through factoring, our partners purchase your outstanding 30-, 60-, or 90-day invoices for immediate cash, minus a fee. 

This service is for businesses selling B2B or B2G (business-to-government) with a minimal average monthly revenue of $20k. All factoring deals brokered through Spearfish include credit risk insurance. This protects you from customers who may fail to pay their invoices if they become insolvent during the factoring period. \

Note: We also server as a broker for SBA loans.

## Advisory Services and Consulting

We can structure deals that include various forms of financing. Tell us about your situation and goals and we'll advise on smart options. 

From there we'll handle the application process and work with our financial partners to provide funding solutions to those who qualify.

In addition, we serve as advisors to early stage businesses in the Boston metro area. 

## Crisis and innovation

Following the 2008 recession, small business owners found it increasingly difficult to obtain the funding they needed.  

Banks, laboring under substantial losses, grappled with new regulatory and capital requirements.  

In this environment, small business loans -- already viewed as risky -- were considered unattractive. 

Innovators stepped into the gap and an entire movement known as alternative lending or alternative finance was launched.

## What makes us different?   

Spearfish has two key advantages. 

### We take a consultative approach

<p></p>

Our goal is to find the best fit for your situation, quickly. We don’t impose a one-size-fits-all solution. We prize repeat business.  

### Fast funding that's smart

<p></p>

Our proprietary funding partnerships are managed daily by a New York City-based industry veteran with over 20 years of finance experience. Enjoy ultra-fast, simplified deals from some of the best -- and most highly rated -- names in finance.
