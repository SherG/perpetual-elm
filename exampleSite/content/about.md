## Crisis and innovation

Following the 2008 recession, small business owners found it increasingly difficult to obtain the funding they needed.  

Banks, laboring under substantial losses, grappled with new regulatory and capital requirements.  

In this environment, small business loans -- already viewed as risky -- were considered unattractive. 

Innovates stepped into the gap and an entire movement known as alternative lending or alternative finance was launched.

## What makes us different?   

Spearfish has two key advantages. 
<ol>
<li><p>We take a consultative approach. </p>
    Our goal is to find the best fit for your situation, quickly. We don’t impose a one-size-fits-all solution. We prize repeat business.  
<li><p>Fast funding that's smart and rooted in experience</p>
   Our proprietary funding network was created by, and is maintained daily by, a New York City-based industry veteran with over 20 years of finance experience. This allows us open the door to ultra-fast, simplified deals from some of the biggest -- and most highly rated -- names in finance.</p>
